Features:

- Make a shape type -- should have all triangles in memory, radius, bounding box, etc.
- Some basic shapes -- (e.g. circle, box, etc.)
- Loading shapes from disk
- Task list
- Sprite list
- Figure out collisions (gross, exact, intriangle, etc.)
- A few more shaders (e.g. colors)
- A few more printing functions (e.g. highlight, outer border, ect.)
- some iterations over mouse dragging, see inline todos
- collisions: add separate triangles for collisions, add intriangle methods
- Lighting, normals!

Refactorings:

- Rename `mygraphics` into `game_engine`
- Extract a camera with draw calls or something equivalent, able to run parallel
- Extract `graphics` tied to glium/opengl, single threaded

Considerations:

- a second pass for filtering
