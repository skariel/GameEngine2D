# THIS IS ALL PRE-ALPHA! NO DOCS!

##a game engine!

###why?
- to learn rust
- to have some fun, my last game engine was written in Pascal anout 20 years ago (! I cant believe this much time has passed)

###Why GPL?
Because I would like to have some income from something I love doing, for e.g. writing games. GPL leaves me the option to sell commercial licenses for people that actually need them to make money (dual licensing like MySQL does)

###But waaaaay?!
I am aware this can detract potential contributors and users; However I suspect I'm better at creating game engines than games. This is the reason I'm better off selling the engine. Making a successful game requires game-design skill, a skill much broader than programming. A good game designer can create an addictive game, he knows what patterns work on human psychology, he is a good storyteller, he can answer how should difficulty change with time, what rewards to give, etc. On the other hand writing a game engine requires programming skill, the ability to maximize performance; it requires dealing with computers more than with people. And this is my stronger side. I'm a computers person :)

###Goals
in order of importance:
- maximum speed!
- parallelization
- easy interface
- develop many sample usages
- develop alongside a close source game
